Setup
-----

For toy example and fourier networks notebook, just install torch and pytorch-lightning or whatever is missing in the arbitrary order and it should work. I don't really use any fancy packages or complex dependencies so you should be able to brute force it. I added my own requirements.txt file, but I don't guarantee you can build an environment from it.

NOTE: Point cloud stuff is not guaranteed to work, these are the files from the initial version of the project.
